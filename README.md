# Flights Delay Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze flight delay statistics for three potential connector airports: Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), and Minneapolisâˆ’Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). The analysis will provide insights into the reliability of flight services at these airports based on historical data.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the US Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). It includes information on flight schedules, actual departure and arrival times, cancellations, diversions, and other relevant variables.

## Project Tasks
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Explore and visualize flight data to understand the number of flights departing and arriving from each airport.
3. Analyze cancelled and diverted flights to assess their impact on reliability.
4. Clean the data by removing cancelled and diverted flights.
5. Extract time information from departure and arrival times.
6. Calculate departure and arrival delays.
7. Filter delayed flights based on specified criteria.
8. Analyze the distribution and statistics of flight delays.
9. Identify patterns of delays by day of the week, month, and over time.
10. Identify the top ten planes with the worst departure delays.
